    <p><em><Strong>What is automated testing?</em></Strong> </p>
    <p> Automated Testing is the automatic running of coded tests that will perform an end to end user journey to ensure complete functionality</p>
    <p><em><Strong>Why do we automate our tests?</em></Strong> </p>
    <p> We automate the tests to speed up the testing process, automation at first may be an expense but over time the cost is recoperated by time saved during test execution</p>
    <p><em><Strong>What tests should be automated??</em></Strong> </p>
        <p>We should only automate tests that will be repeated frequently to reduce effort, time and costs. The most common approach is to automate any regression tests that are performed after every release on the given project</p>
